# Graph Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of three search algorithms: Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Search, and A* Search. These methods are used to find the optimal or most efficient path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

## Algorithms

- UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
- Greedy Search
- A* Search

## Context

These algorithms were applied to a simple graph to find a path from node A to node F. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file.
